## Background

As a **Computer Programming student** and **tutor at Lambton College**, I noticed a growing need for a tool to help students practice quizzes before their tests. While working as a tutor, I realized that I wanted to expand my leadership and collaborative skills outside the tutoring center, which inspired me to create the **NodeJS Quizzes App**.

This app not only addresses the need for quiz practice but also showcases my abilities in **Full Stack development**, including building secure user authentication, managing dynamic content, and handling data efficiently. I developed this project with the goal of offering students a practical resource while also furthering my own professional growth.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system.
- **Create and Manage Quizzes**: Users can create multiple-choice and true/false quizzes.
- **Real-Time Quiz Scoring**: Instant feedback with real-time scoring after completing a quiz.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive for mobile and desktop users, making it accessible on any device.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend logic and server-side operations.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling routing and requests.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing quiz data, user information, and results.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for dynamic content rendering.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive and modern UI design.
